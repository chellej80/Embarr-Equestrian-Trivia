# Embarr Equestrian Trivia Challenge 

## Overview

Embarr Equestrian Trivia challenge is a website page designed to be part of a bigger site for example Embarr Equestrian . The quiz page is targeted at horse owners or horse lovers  that would like a simple fun interactive way of learning about general horse knowledge or care.

The page design was developed with mobile responsiveness at the forefront. It consists of one html page that should be developed further with improvements to the page structure in order to integrate with its master website [Embarr Equestrian - Deployed Site Link](https://chellej80.github.io/Embarr-Equestrian/).

## Testing Conducted 

### Usability testing 
I had work colleagues and family members assistance to test the site usability. The conclusion of this testing was that:
- All pages of the site were understandable and easy to use
- Buttons, links, and fields were convenient for use
- There is access to the Main navigation menu from all pages via the desktop version and mobile version.

### Content 

I reviewed all content on the site for:
- grammar and spelling mistakes
- Images are placed properly with proper sizes &    displaying as expected
- Instructions are clear and contain correct information
- Verified all text/ headings are displaying correctly

### Navigation

I tested all the navigation functions via desktop and mobile/ ipad to ensure that they are functioning and linking to the correct pages.

### Links testing

I tested all the hyperlinked text/ images/ nav items to ensure that there were no broken links and that they were linking to the correct locations on the site and/or opening in a new window if expected.

### Effects Testing 

I tested that all hover effects were working for the nav menu/ the image text overlay/ the slideshow arrows.



### Performance

I ran the site through the lighthouse performance tool for developers: 
[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
<img src=assets/media/Lighthouse.PNG>

Given more time I would look at the passive listeners to improve scrolling performance, and also the images/ youtube videos in order to improve the performance score

I tested the site responsiveness on my iphone/ ipad and my family/ friends android mobile devices to ensure the site was rendering and functional across a range of devices.
